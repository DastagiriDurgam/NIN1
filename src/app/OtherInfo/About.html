                Many chronic diseases have been directly or indirectly associated with Nutrition. It is important to understand and know
                the optimal requirement of nutrients for good health and wellbeing. The aim of this app is to provide useful
                and necessary information on nutrients available in food and their daily requirements. The app provides data
                on raw foods and recipes with their nutrient composition. The app aids in assessing your nutritional status,
                required dietary allowance (RDA), daily food intake and energy expenditure.

                We have made the app as a general awareness tool on nutrition and health. This app is not intended to treat or cure diseases
                and should not be used for this purpose. Nutrient values of some cooked foods are based on raw ingredients
                and therefore nutrients lost during the process of cooking are not taken into account. Further, there is
                no added salt during cooking for some recipes.
